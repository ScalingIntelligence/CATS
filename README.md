## Overview

Our paper, "CATS: Contextually-Aware Thresholding for Sparsity in Large Language Models," introduces CATSâ€”a new method aimed at reducing the computational demands of deploying LLMs without sacrificing their performance on downstream tasks. This method centers around a novel activation function that enhances activation sparsity effectively and efficiently.

The CATS approach can be applied to various base models such as Mistral-7B and Llama2-7B, demonstrating a minimal performance drop (within 1-2% of the base models) even at 50% activation sparsity levels. Importantly, CATS not only accelerates convergence but also integrates a custom GPU kernel that enhances inference speeds by approximately 15%.

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the experimental results and figures presented in our work, please follow the steps outlined below. The process has been simplified into a single script to ensure ease of use and to maintain consistency across different environments.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Bash shell (Unix/Linux/Mac)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Set an `accelerate` configuration file based on your environment by running `accelerate config`

### Steps

1. Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

```bash
bash reproduction_script.sh [path1] [path2]
```

- [path1]: Directory where the checkpoints for fine-tuned models will be stored.
- [path2]: Directory where the results of the experiments, such as figures and histograms, will be saved.

## Work in progress

We are currently developing a framework that will enable CATS to be easily integrated with any model from the HuggingFace library.
